# ðŸ“‚ Node.js File Manager Server

A simple HTTP server built with Node.js that allows users to **create**, **read**, and **delete** text files through URL query parameters. This project uses `async/await` and `fs.promises` for modern, clean asynchronous operations.

---

## âœ… Features
- Built using core Node.js (`http`, `fs.promises`, `url`, `path`)
- Uses modern `async/await` pattern for better readability
- Handles all routes with proper error checks and HTTP status codes
- Automatically creates `files` folder if not present

## ðŸš€ Endpoints
- `/create?filename=test.txt&content=Hello` â†’ creates a file
- `/read?filename=test.txt` â†’ reads file content
- `/delete?filename=test.txt` â†’ deletes the file

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights
- Refactored legacy callback-based code to Promises + `async/await`
- Follows best practices in error handling and folder structure
- Easy to extend with routes like `/list` or `/rename`

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run
```bash
npm start
